# Fatima's Day in Dreamland
Assets I made/modified for a game created to celebrate the two-year mark of my relationship. Most assets are modified versions of others, and if you decide to use them, you need to give credit to the original creators;

- Fatima's dress sprites are a modified version of: https://route1rodent.itch.io/16x16-rpg-character-sprite-sheet

- The tilesets are modified versions of: https://opengameart.org/content/zelda-like-tilesets-and-sprites
